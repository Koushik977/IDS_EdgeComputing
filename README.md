# IDS for Wearable Health Monitoring Devices  

An Intrusion Detection System (***IDS***) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and issues alerts when such activity is discovered. It is a software application that scans a network or a system for harmful activity or policy breaching. Any such risks or violation is normally reported to an administrator. A simple firewall provides the foundation for network security, but many advanced threats can slip past it. An IDS adds an additional line of defense, making it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to user’s network undetected.&nbsp;

## What the project does ?

> Wearable devices are currently at the heart of just about every discussion related to the Internet of Things. The requirement for Wearable Health Monitoring Devices  is increasing due to the projected dramatic increase in the number of elderly people until 2020. Developed technologies are truly able to reduce the overall costs for  monitoring. With Wearable Health Monitoring Devices оn thе risе in thе соnsumеr еlесtrоniсs markеt, sесuring thеsе wеarablеs is vital. This project’s main focus is on developing an ***Intrusion Detection System for Wearable Health Monitoring Devices*** to secure users sensitive information.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
## Why the project is useful ?

> Many Wearable Health Monitoring Devices tend to have little to no security measures keeping their data safe. The fact that much of the data is ***unencrypted*** and that most of these devices use ***Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections*** to transmit data means cybercriminals can get their hands on it pretty easily. It's important to consider how this information becomes ***big data*** to be collected and used by companies and governments. This means, whether you like it or not, that your tracked information could be used for marketing or health purposes. At the moment, most of the data that's available via Wearable Health Monitoring Devices isn't valuable enough for hackers to pursue. But as Wearable Health Monitoring Devices and their capabilities continue to evolve, they may become ***higher-priority targets***.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;
## Results 

> Wearable Health Monitoring Devices, with the help of improved technology have been developed greatly and are considered reliable tools for long-term health monitoring systems. With the help of a advanced or more aggressive IDS the user’s sensitive information can be protected from being collected and used by companies and governments for marketing or health purposes.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;
## Conclusions

> Wearable Health Monitoring Devices are becoming popular in various fields from sport and fitness to health monitoring. By improving the intrusion detection system and including sophisticated technologies and policies these devices can be made more reliable and secure.&nbsp;
